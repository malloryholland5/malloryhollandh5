# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Mallory Holland  
**Recent M.S. Data Science Graduate | Data-Driven Problem Solver | Business-Focused Analyst**

I'm a recent graduate with a Masterâ€™s in Data Science and a background in operations, employee training, and cost optimization. My portfolio reflects hands-on experience using Python, Power BI, and machine learning to solve real-world problemsâ€”from forecasting housing market trends and analyzing social media engagement to building models for loan prediction and R&D efficiency.  

Iâ€™m passionate about uncovering insights that drive smarter business decisions and excited to bring analytical thinking, creativity, and clear communication to a data-focused role.
